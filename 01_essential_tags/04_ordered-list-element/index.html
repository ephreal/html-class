  <!-- An ordered list (ol) is very similar
       to an unordered list. The main
       difference is in what is displayed
       to the left of the <li> elements.

       In the case of an ordered list, the
       elements have numeric values in
       front of them. Note: ordered lists
       start counting at 1.
