       This is a comment. Comments are used
       to explain things to someone who may
       be reading the code, like you. You'll
       notice if you download this file and
       try view it in a web browser, nothing
       shows up. This is because comments are
       ignored by the browser.

       The formatting of a comment varies
       from person to person, although
       some style guides likely exist. My
       personal comment style is influenced
       by my python background, which means:

       Make comments complete sentences.
       Capitalization is important.
       Block comments should be paragraph
       formatted.

       In addition, I like to keep the width
       of my comments short, as I personally
       believe it looks nice.

      Note how this text is surrounded by
      two tags. The start tag has the <!
      followed by two dashes. That denotes
      the start of a comment. The end of
      the comment is two dashes followed
      by the closing >. I'd put these
      both in here, but it'd break the
      comment.
