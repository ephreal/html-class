  <!-- Using an anchor element -->
  <a href="https://google.com" class="bright">Find out anything!</a>

  <!--
      Explanation:
      Both CSS styles evaluate to a specificity value of 10.
      In this case, it's order, not size, that matters. The
      href attribute was declared AFTER the bright class.
      Since it was declared after the bright class, the style
      for the bright class was applied first, and then
      overwritten by the href attribute selector. This leaves
      us with the attribute selector style.
