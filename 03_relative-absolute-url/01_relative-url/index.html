      Relative URLs tell the document where to
      find something in relation to itself. A
      relative URL does not start with a "/"
      like an absolute URL because it is not
      starting it's search from the root of
      the website. It starts in the folder it
      currently occupies.

  <!--
      For example, to locate the dog.png which
      is in the same folder as this document,
      I simply put dog.png in the src attribute.
      It searches in the folder the index.html
      is in, finds the image labeled dog.png,
      and then uses it.
  -->
  <img src="dog.png">

  <!--
      To find an image in the img folder, we
      start the URL with "img/" and then the
      name of the file. In this case,
      "img/cat.jpeg". Once again, this searches
      the current folder for a folder called
      "img", goes into it, and searches for a
      file named cat.jpeg
  -->
  <img src="img/cat.jpeg">

  <!--
      Note that having a separate folder for
      images is a common thing to do. Leaving
      a ton of images at the root of the folder,
      while it may work, is messy and creates
      trouble trying to find the things you
      might be looking for.
