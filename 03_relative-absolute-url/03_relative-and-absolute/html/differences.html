    Note that if this is not server off of a webserver, the absolute URL will not resolve properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Absolute URL to an image in the img folder on troubleshooting a printer
  </p>
  <img src="/img/printer_troubleshooting.jpg" alt="">
  <p>
    Now a relative path to the same one
  </p>
  <img src="../img/printer_troubleshooting.jpg" alt="">
  <!--
      As we're not on a webserver, the benefits of an
      absolute URL aren't as easy to see. But trust me,
      when you have something that will never move,
      and it's being used in many places, an Absolute
      URL is nice to be able to use.
