      Absolute URLs start their search for the
      file at the root of the website directory.
      This is useful because no matter where
      the file may be, it is able to find the
      file referenced in the URL.

      A URL starts with a "/", which indicates
      the root of the website. The root of the
      website is the main folder containing
      all the files for the website. In this
      case, the document root should be
      02_absolute_url. In reality, because
      this is not being served off a webserver,
      the computer will go all the way back
      to my computer's root.

      I will show examples of what the absolute
      URL looks like, but know that unless you
      are serving this off a webserver, the URL
      is not going to resolve properly, and you
      won't see the pictures.
