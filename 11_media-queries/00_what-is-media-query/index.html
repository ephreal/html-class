      A media query is used to apply different CSS rulesets based on
      certain conditions. A query is made up of a media type and an
      expression. The media type is optional, and you can have 0 or
      more expressions. This can be used for changing layout for
      smaller screens, larger screens, printing pages, etc.

      Media queries can be done in two ways: Directly in the CSS,
      or in the link to our html sytlesheet. Making a link is
      the preferred method, as it only delivers the code that's
      needed rather than a single huge CSS sheet. I will be using
      media queries in my links.

      Check out the <head> of this page for a media query example.
      You can also check the stylesheets to see how they will
      change the text.

      Change the size of the screen to see the differences.
