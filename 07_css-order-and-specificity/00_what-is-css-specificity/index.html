      CSS specicifity determines which css rule is applied by the
      browser. This is interpreted by determining which rule is
      the most specific. IE. a class is more specific than an element
      and would have the rule applied. An ID is even more specific
      than a class and would have priority over a class. If two rules
      have the same specificity, then the last one used counts. This
      is why despite this having two stylesheets linked, my css
      changes still takes affect. To learn more about this, I recommend
      reading through the following:

      https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
      https://specificity.keegan.st/

      Some examples follow
  -->

  <!-- Element with class and attribute both changing background color -->
  <p>Note that the background color is green. An attribute tag for a
     specific element is more specific than a class.</p>
  <a href="https://google.com" class="dark">To Google and beyond!</a>

  <!-- A div tag with a href attribute also being modified by a class. -->
  <p>Note that the square is yellow. An attribute tag is just as
     specific as a class, but the attribute ruleset was declared
     second in the css.</p>
  <div href="google.com" class="dark"></div>

  <!-- A div tag with two classes applied, both changing colors.
       The pink backround color is declared after the first -->
  <p>Note that this one is pink. A class declared after another
     class in the stylesheet takes precedence over the first one
     declared. It does not matter which order the div class="class1
     class2" is used either. All that matters is priority in the
     stylesheet.</p>
  <div class="dark cake"></div>

  <!-- A div tag with an ID and an href attribute -->
  <p>Note that this one is light green. The id is far more specific
     than an attribute</p>

  <div id="lightforest" href="https://google.com"></div>

  <!-- Note that if something is not overwritten, only the changes the
       higher specificity makes will be applied.  -->
  <h1 class="dark">Note that I am still bordered despite having the
                   text color and background color overwritten.</h1>
