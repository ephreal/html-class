/*
 *
 * Padding and margin adds whitespace inside and between elements.
 * Padding and margin are easiest understood with having a
 * border between the padding and the margin. Think of the
 * html element as a box full of stuff. The thing you display is
 * the content. The padding is stuff you put inside the box to
 * keep it where you want it. The border is the box itself, and
 * the margin is the space between other boxes.
 *
 * syntax:
 * padding: <amount>px/em/%
 * margin: <amount> px/em/%
 *
 * You can pass 1,2, or 4 values in for padding and margin. If
 * you pass in one, then the value applies to all sides. If you
 * pass in 2, the first applies to the top and bottom, and the
 * second to the right and left. And if you pass in 4, they
 * apply starting from the top and going clockwise, which is to
 * say, top right bottom left.
 *
 * You can also pass in auto to make the margin sides equal.
 *
 * See here for more detail.
