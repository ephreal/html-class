This repo details anything that I do during my html class. 

This will have example of what to do, what not to do (Hopefully on purpose), and information related to getting started with html/css.

Currently this has the following:
Basic HTML tags and how to use them
Tags with some attributes and an explanation of those attributes.
Some examples of relative and absolute URLs

If anyone reading through my information finds something out of place, misleading, or outright wrong, please let me know. I'd love to keep this up to date and accurate.
