This repo details anything that I do during my html class. It will be structured as through I am trying to teach someone how to build a website because I learn best when I learn to teach someone.  

This will have example of what to do, what not to do (Hopefully on purpose), and information related to getting started with html/css.

Currently this has the following:  
 -Basic HTML tags and how to use them  
 -Tags with some attributes and an explanation of those attributes.  
 -Some examples of relative and absolute URLs  
 -Basic CSS properties/pseudo classes  
 -Some exercises to try  

If anyone reading through my information finds something out of place, misleading, or outright wrong, please let me know. I'd love to keep this up to date and accurate.

If I've helped you and you'd like to say thanks, send me an email, or send some coins. I'll put some addresses in here later.
