      Flexbox is an additional tool to create a page layout. Flexbox
      requires understaning two concepts: Containers and Items.

      A Flex container is some continer on the page that is set to
      display: flex; in the css stylesheet. This could be an id, a
      class, an element, etc.

      When a container is set to be a flex container, you can manage
      the layout with the properties shown later on. Anything that is
      a direct child of the flex container is considered a flex item.

      In summary, you create a flex container in order to manipulate
      flex items through flex css properties. Examples follow.

  <main class="flex_content">
    <!-- direct child divs are affected -->
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <section>
      <!--
           The div inside the section is not a flex item.
           It is not a direct child. This does NOT mean
           flex is going to ignore. Rather, anything done
           with flex affects the section containing the div.

      <div></div>
    </section>
    <div></div>
  </main>
