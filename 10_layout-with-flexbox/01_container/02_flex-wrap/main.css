/*
  By default, flex tries to fit everything onto one line. Sometimes,
  this is not what you want. To allow items to wrap around onto
  another line if the current line is full, use flex-wrap.

  flex-wrap: nowrap is the default setting.

  flex-wrap can take three values: wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse.
  Of the three, wrap-reverse might bear a little more mentioning.
  flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; will wrap items onto the top of the
  previous items when it runs out of space. While wrap acts like
  you have inserted a newline below the original content,
  wrap-reverse acts like you put the original content below the
  the content after it. Play around with the css here and see for
  yourself.
