       Semantic HTML is HTML that conveys the meaning of the HTML being used.
       This means using tags such as <article> for article contents, <section>
       for some similar content, etc.

       Using Semantic HTML is recommend because it makes the code more readable,
       maintainable, easier for search engines to categorize, easier for screen
       readers to parse, etc. In short, it makes life easier for many things
       overall.

       Using semantic HTML will let you structure your HTML in a more logical
       fashion.
