  <!--
       This is primarily an example showing the use of
       the class tag. I have defined a clas externally
       in the main.css file. This class is called
       "dark". It makes the background color of all
       items with "dark" as the class have a dark
       background color with a light font.

       The class attribute is declared like any other.
       <tag class="dark">text</tag>
  -->

  <!-- first some text without the class -->
  <p>Here is some normal text inside a p element</p>

  <p class="dark">It was a dark and stormy night.</p>
