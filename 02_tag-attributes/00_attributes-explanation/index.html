      An attribute is a way to bring additional
      functionality to an element. Some elements
      require an attribute to be provided, such
      as an image element needing to be told
      where to find said image.

      Other attributes are not mandatory to put
      in, but they to change how the element
      works or provide additional information
      about the element. For example, the image
      element may not require the height element
      to be provied, but providing it will
      change the size of the image when it is
      displayed.

      Attributes are added to an element by
      opening the first tag and declaring which
      element you want to add in. For example,
      the image element has a src tag which
      tells it where to find the image. To add
      the src attribute to the image element, I
      do the following.

      <image src="some_directory/some_image.jpg">

      This format applies anywhere.

      <tag attribute1="attribute_value" attribute2="".......>

      Some elements can take many attributes. I'll
      list off the ones in use today when I create
      a document about each element and also provide
      a link to a document of the attributes for
      further reading.
