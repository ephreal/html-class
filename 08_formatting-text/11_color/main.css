/*
 * color changes the color of the font. Nothing else. It's
 * not for background coloration, does not change the color
 * of something else on the page, nothing. Just font color.
 * It's easiest to get a grip on that from the start.
 *
 * Color can accept values for rgba, rgb, hexadecimal, and hsla.
 * It can also accept a color name such as blue or moccasin.
 * The a in rgba and hsla is the opacity, which is either a
 * percentage or number from 0.0 to 1.0.
 * Each is used as follows:
 *
 * RGB : rbg(1-255, 1-255, 1-255)
 * rgba : rgba(1-255, 1-255, 1-255, 0.0-1.0)
 * hsl : hsl(1-360, 0-100%, 0-100%)
 * hsla : hsla(1-360, 0-100%, 0-100%, 0-100%)
 *
