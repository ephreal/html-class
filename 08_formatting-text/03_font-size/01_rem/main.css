 * rem = root M
 * Comes from the days of old ink presses that had to measure the
 * size of fonts somehow. They did this off the size of the letter
 * M.
 * The root is the browser's default settings. Using rem allows
 * for dynamic scaling based on user preferences. Rem scales the
 * text sized based off the root font size.
