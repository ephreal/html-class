       Default font settings vary from browser to browser. Depending on
       how each was originally set up, it can vary. For example, Chrome
       has a default font size of 16 px. Other browsers may choose a
       different size. For this reason, setting font sizes using pixel
       measurements is a bit brittle, especially if someone requires
       larger font size. This document shows how to set the font size
       with pixel measurements, and later on I'll transistion to rem.

   <p>Here is an extremely interesting note.</p>
   <p class="larger">This one MUST be more important.</p>
   <!--
        Note that it's possible to "change" the font size in the browser
        by zooming in. Forcing someone to do that is just kinda annoying
        them though, so rem is recommended.
