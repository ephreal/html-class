/*
 * font-family specifies a list of one or more font family
 * names and/or generic family names for the selected element.
 * This lets you change the font, change how the font is
 * rendered, etc.
 *
 * When choosing a font family, you need to include one non
 * specific font, such as monospace,serif, sans-serif, etc.
 * Otherwise the font will have no default value. The default
 * value is used to select a fallback font if the main font
 * is not installed on the computer.
 *
 * Sans-serif fonts are claimed to be more readable in web
 * browsers, and using sans-serif fonts is recommended.
