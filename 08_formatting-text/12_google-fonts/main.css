/*
 * Google fonts can be used to make your life and the user's
 * life far easier. Rather than trying to create a custom
 * font, using google fonts allows you to stylize your
 * fonts without more work.
 *
 * To find some, just google google-fonts. It was located
 * here at the time of this writing:
 * https://google.com/fonts
 *
 * Do note that additional fonts are downloaded to the
 * client's machine, so super slow connections may be
 * affected.
 *
 * Adding in the font is pretty straightforward. Google will
 * provide a link to add to your <head> section that links
 * to the font. Go check the index.html to see this. Remember
 * that the order of linking does make a difference, so link
 * the fonts before your stylesheet.
 *
 * You then choose the font like you always would with the
 * font-family.
